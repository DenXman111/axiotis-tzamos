To run solutions and compare the results, you need to run two comands in your bash terminal: g++ --std=c++11 ./knapsack/testing/tester.cpp; ./a.exe
To run solutions on the other testcase you need to open ./knapsack/testing/tester.cpp, change test path and run the program.
You have the same process for unbounded_knapsack, just change knapsack to unbounded_knapsack in the path.
